# hello-world
First repository

I am a university student studying software engineering. Our professor is teaching us how to use Git so I decided to try and become as proficient as posible by joining gitHub to learn, grow and develop my git skills. I also hope to learn from reviewing code written by other developers and hopefully will commit some collaboration as well.
